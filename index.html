        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Hannah Garcia, and Iâ€™m currently a second-year Neuroscience major at the University of California, Riverside. Iâ€™m passionate about healthcare, community service, and Iâ€™m working toward my long-term goal of attending Physician Assistant (PA) school after I graduate. I am originally from Fullerton, California, in Orange County. Outside of academics, I stay deeply involved on campus and in my community. At UCR, Iâ€™m a proud member of Highlander EMS, a student-run volunteer organization that provides emergency medical services and promotes health and safety across campus. Through Highlander EMS, Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience working in a team environment, responding to real-world situations, and supporting my peers in times of need. Itâ€™s helped me grow not only as a future healthcare professional but also as a leader and communicator. In addition to volunteering, I also work as a certified EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) outside of school. This job has given me hands-on clinical experience, exposed me to diverse medical situations, and strengthened my confidence in high-pressure environments. Balancing work and school at the same time has taught me time management, discipline, and the importance of self-care. In addition to being a member of highlander EMS, I am also involved with cultural clubs on campus such as Vietnamese Student Association and Katipunan which is the Filipino culture club on campus.<br><br>

        While my academic and career interests are rooted in the sciences, Iâ€™m also someone who values connection and creativity. I love spending quality time with my friends and family, and I believe itâ€™s important to balance your academics alongside your personal life. I really enjoy trying new food spots including restaurants and cafes. I love trying new matcha places, with my favorite being Archive of Us located in Los Angeles, or Airoma which is located in Garden Grove. Some other places and cafes I enjoy are Stereoscope which is located in Buena Park and Danzzaan which is located in Rowland Heights. Iâ€™m also very excited to be taking this computer science class. Another one of my hobbies is playing tennis, as I love being active in general. I like to workout in my free time and I enjoy sports like tennis, pickle ball, or swimming. In high school I played on the tennis team so it is something I enjoy doing. I love playing badminton at the Student Recreation Center at UC Riverside. I also love walking my dogs and going on hikes.<br><br>

        Although itâ€™s outside of my major, I believe that understanding technology and programming is increasingly important in the healthcare field. From electronic medical records to health data analysis and AI-driven diagnostics, computer science plays a growing role in modern medicine. Iâ€™m looking forward to learning more about this subject, challenging myself in new ways, and seeing how these skills might complement my work as a future healthcare provider. Overall, Iâ€™m someone who is driven, compassionate, and curious. Iâ€™m excited for what the future holds with this class and am committed to growing both personally and professionally as I continue my journey toward becoming a PA.
